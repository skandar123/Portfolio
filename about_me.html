										<br>
									I was born and raised in Mumbai, India, where I developed a wide range of interests from an early age. As a child, I received training in singing, dancing, drawing, swimming, karate, and playing the tabla — a classical Indian percussion instrument. Alongside these creative pursuits, I also discovered a passion for computers during my school years, which ultimately shaped my career path in the field of Information Technology.
								<br><br>
								I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Mumbai University, where I deepened my interest in software and systems. Upon graduation, I began my professional journey with Wipro as a Technical Consultant. There, I worked as a Microsoft Support Engineer, helping global business administrators troubleshoot and resolve issues related to Microsoft Exchange, Outlook, and Office 365. I also played a key role in migrating on-premise mailboxes to the cloud. I was part of Microsoft’s only Outlook support team globally, gaining valuable exposure to enterprise-level technical challenges.
								<br><br>
								To further my education, I moved to the United States and pursued a Master’s in Computer Science and Software Engineering from George Mason University. During this time, I interned at Superinterns.com as a Web Designer, working directly under the CEO. My contributions improved the company’s website and increased national visibility — a performance appreciated in a CEO recommendation. Click here to see the CEO's recommendation.
								<br><br>
								After completing my master’s, I joined News America Marketing as a Business Analyst. In this role, I was part of a 25-member team working on the Oracle 11i to Oracle Financials Upgrade ERP project. I was responsible for gathering business requirements, writing and testing use cases, and supporting the project through the Scrum Agile process. I facilitated both System Integration Testing (SIT) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and tracked issues to closure using JIRA. Additionally, I reviewed and edited comprehensive user guides to support system documentation and user onboarding.
								<br><br>
								Later, I transitioned into a Full Stack Developer role at Winopoly Publishing, where I built a custom application to automate internal business processes. I handled the entire development lifecycle — from analyzing company needs to designing, coding, testing, deploying, and maintaining the application. My tech stack included PHP, LAMP, MongoDB, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Smarty templates, and SVN. I regularly addressed bugs, implemented new features, and trained both business users and new developers to ensure smooth adoption and maintenance.
								<br><br>
								To expand my business acumen and leadership skills, I began pursuing an MBA at Zicklin School of Business, broadening my understanding of business strategy, product development, and organizational behavior.
								<br><br>
								Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at The Next Milestone Technologies, where I contribute to the design, development, testing, and documentation of various projects using a wide range of technologies:

								Laravel, PHP, JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX), HTML, CSS, MySQL, Java 8, JDBC, Python, PostgreSQL, Maven, Drools, AWS, Docker, Git, GitLab, Gemini, and more. I actively maintain code quality using SonarQube, perform software upgrades, and build features for applications such as:
								<ul>
									<li>An HR Magazine website</li>
									<li>A Learning Management System (LMS)</li>
									<li>Live analytics dashboards</li>
									<li>AI-powered enhancements for LMS</li>
									<li>Two database comparison tools for validation and optimization</li>
								</ul>	
								
								Throughout my career, I’ve combined my technical skills with a deep understanding of user needs and business goals. I enjoy working on meaningful software that simplifies workflows, enhances performance, and delivers measurable value.
